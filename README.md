# 14x
14x practice and extra material not covered in class.


_Nothing covered is done so in a conclusive or complete fashion; use it as a starting place, not as a complete guide. Start one, see if you can find uses for it, and then google to find more._

###**Unless explicitly told otherwise, all concepts in Advanced.java are considered advanced material and strictly forbidden on assignments. Using them can and will result in a point penalty on your homework.** 


##Commands in Advanced.java:
* "_print hello world_" -> prints "hello world!";
* "_ternary_" -> mini - tutorial on the ternary operator;
* "_binary_" -> mini - tutorial on binary representations;
* "_regex_" -> mini - tutorial on regular expressions;
* "_try/catch_" -> mini - tutorial on try / catch blocks;
* "_xor_" -> mini - tutorial on xor (exclusive or);
* "_lambda expressions_" -> mini - tutorial on lambda expressions;
* "_quit_" -> ends the program;

###Uses for those things? [non-exhaustive, google is your friend]
* printing hello world : hey, now you know what a switch statement is.
* Ternary ? It can make code a little cleaner, and remove redundancy a bit : If you nest it too much like in the last example in Advanced, then it gets ugly really fast.
* Binary :

	[But there are actual uses, google it!]
* Regex : grep some stuff up for fast searches that can be very particular. But just look at documentation; you've already been using regular expressions if you have ever used String.split(regex), just likely really simple ones.
* try/catch : Because you don't always want to crash when something bad happens.
* xor : Simply if conditions, make some things that seem like magic happen (What happens if you xor a number by the same number, twice?) and more
* lambda expressions : Used in Graphical User Interfaces a lot. Less common in Java (only added recently), but can work some magic in other programming languages that use it.
