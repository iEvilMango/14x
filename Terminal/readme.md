# Basic usage of terminal
_For OS X; Linux and Windows versions exist and are generally fairly similar, but it'd be worth googling around for a specific tutorial_

This tutorial will show the basics of making traversing your file system with the bash terminal (default for os x), as well as making files / directories, and running java programs and python scripts


## cd 
![cd for change directory](imgs/cd_dir(1).png)
__a.__ The important part of this section is the tilde (~) at the end. That refers to the root of the file directory (should just be the base user folder).

__b.__ The user; I'm logged in as Joey.

__c.__ the cd command is for change directory; changes directory to the given directory (folder).

__d.__ parameter for cd; using relative pathing (from where I currently am), go into the 14x directory in the GitHub directory. The tilde symbol can be used to refer to the base directory (i.e. cd ~ or cd ~/GitHub)
